## Description

This tool provides several key features for understanding and working with Bezier curves:

1. Interactive Drawing Tool
   - Draw curves directly on a canvas
   - Automatic fitting of Bezier curves to drawn points
   - Real-time visualization of control points

2. Bernstein Polynomial Visualization
   - View the individual Bernstein basis functions
   - See the partition of unity property
   - Interactive plots with customizable degree

3. Vector Visualization
   - View control point influence through vector visualization
   - See sequential vector addition at any point along the curve
   - Interactive visualization of curve construction

4. Dark Mode Support
   - Full dark mode support for all visualizations
   - Configurable styling options

## How to Use

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wayrion/Bezier-Fitter.git
cd Bezier-Fitter
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Tool

1. Basic Usage:
```python
python bezier_visualization.py
```

2. Interactive Drawing:
   - Click and drag on the canvas to draw a curve
   - Release to complete the drawing
   - The tool will automatically fit a Bezier curve to your drawing

3. Viewing Visualizations:
   - After drawing, the tool will show:
     - Your original curve with fitted Bezier curve
     - Bernstein polynomial basis functions
     - Vector visualizations at t=0.5

### Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in the script:

```python
# Basic Configuration
BEZIER_DEGREE = 3  # Change the degree of the Bezier curve
BEZIER_RESOLUTION = 10000  # Adjust curve resolution
DARK_MODE = True  # Toggle dark mode

# Visualization Settings
FIGURE_SIZE = (8, 6)  # Change plot size
FONT_SIZE = 16  # Adjust font size
VECTOR_ALPHA = 0.4  # Modify vector transparency
```

## Examples

### Drawing Mode
1. Start the program
2. Click and drag to draw your curve
3. Release to see the fitted Bezier curve

### Visualization Mode
After drawing, you'll see:
- The original points and fitted curve
- Control points with annotations
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the fit

### Mathematical Visualization
The tool will display:
- Bernstein polynomials for your curve's degree
- Vector influences at t=0.5
- Sequential vector addition visualization

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
